# ether.js
This repo hosts my first tries with ether.js to connect to evm compatible blockchains and learn solidity.
Interaction with the blockchain is through ether.js using typescript with the help of copilot.
There is an accompanying youtube channel [mtvs4u](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo4BndqR2VFkbWO1kNr5j6A)

## Why?
Perhaps it is fun, and the Metaverse needs it.
